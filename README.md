# Banned_Turret
A mechanical servo based rubber band turret program for Arduino.

This is the simple program that runs the rubber band turret I made as my first arduino project. My project is an Arduino powered rubber band turret, a device that will sense movement as well as distance from a target and automatically shoot six rubber bands in a row at the target if the target moves. This turret is a great way to fend off intruders that enter a room (if they have a latex allergy), but is more of a fun project to play around with. 

In order to correctly hit a target, the x axis's are manually controlled via potentiometer whereas the y axis is calculated through a combination of sensors. Distance is sensed through an ultrasonic distance sensor. Height is then calculated through a simple physics formula.
